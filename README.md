# This is no longer mantained.
This project is discontinued and no longer mantained. There are several bugs/errors that aren't fixed, and don't expect them to be fixed. If you actually want to play this game then you will have to face the problem of refactoring the code to work properly.

# pvp-ffa - A (WIP) Garry's Mod gamemode based around PvP.

## Installation

Move the ffa_pvp folder to <steamapps path>/common/GarrysMod/garrysmod/addons
  
## Gameplay

You start with a crossbow, a 357 and an SMG.

Every time you kill an enemy, you get ammo and points.

You can use those points to level up and get goodies such as models, colo(u)r and armor.

## Notes

This gamemode is currently a work in progress. Bugs are to be expected
