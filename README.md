# pvp-ffa - A (WIP) Garry's Mod gamemode based around PvP.

## Installation

Move the ffa_pvp folder to <steamapps path>/common/GarrysMod/garrysmod/addons
  
## Gameplay

You start with a crossbow, a 357 and an SMG.

Every time you kill an enemy, you get ammo and points.

You can use those points to level up and get goodies such as models, colo(u)r and armor.

## Notes

This gamemode is currently a work in progress. Bugs are to be expected.
